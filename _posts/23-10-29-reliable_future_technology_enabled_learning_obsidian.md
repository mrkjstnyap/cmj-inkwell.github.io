Looking back during the pandemic in 2020, one of the biggest challenges I had (aside from the raging global health crisis and our crippling mental health) was feeling helpless in being able to properly process information as a student. My tried-and-true methods of putting thoughts and lessons on paper and annotating journal articles on physical copies were largely disrupted as I had to mostly rely on PDFs and videos. It was a struggle to fully grasp and appreciate the lessons delivered through this new online format. The strewn-about PDFs, mp4s, and Google Classroom interactions felt disconnected and overwhelming. 

My usual methods wouldn't translate well when solely relying on my laptop and phone. I had no system of note taking and I had no prior system that would allow me to adapt to the setup. However, I had very little choice at the time. I also began to realize how my usual methods were already outdated and had several flaws such as not having a reliable method to quickly retrieve notes and connect my thoughts. This dilemma was what eventually led me to discover and come to appreciate Obsidian.  

To start, it would be best if we first delve into how we process information and the difference between note making using a pen and note making through our devices. Secondly, I believe Obsidian as a tool for technology-enabled learning can partially remedy the struggles I mentioned above and with enough practice, it can become a versatile and powerful tool for students and for documenting one's work.

Lastly, while I believe that people would be able to significantly benefit from Obsidian should it be standardized in the classroom and in the workplace, it's just as important to not treat it as the one and only tool that can solve these problems. Ultimately, students will need to learn how to effectively apply note taking strategies whether that be through technology-enabled tools or through longhand writing.

## Note Taking or Note Making?

Note taking is a common activity for everyone. We record information from contact details to recipes and instructions. However, note taking is not just a simple act of recording information and copying text it can also involve some cognitive effort in managing and generating information that is both meaningful and personal. 

The 2005 paper *Cognitive Effort during Note Taking*  ^[Piolat, A., Olive, T., & Kellogg, R. T. (2005). Cognitive Effort during Note Taking. _Applied Cognitive Psychology_, _19_(3), 291–312. [https://doi.org/10.1002/acp.1086](https://doi.org/10.1002/acp.1086)]  provides a more thorough analysis of how note taking is compared to other activities. They showed how the "cognitive effort" of note taking was more demanding than playing chess or reading and learning but may not be as demanding compared to planning and composing creative work.

To better differentiate and simplify the terms, we will be differentiating **note taking** from **note making**. Note taking is an activity for verbatim recording of information without any transformation or changes to the information that is being received (i.e., simply copying a text). In contrast, **note making** is an activity that requires putting in executive attention or cognitive effort by carefully evaluating, synthesizing, and summarizing information that has been received and/or is being actively received. Like any relationship, it needs effort to ***make it work***.

There are various methods such as the Cornell note taking system, outlining, Zettelkasten, mind mapping, or simply just annotating printouts. These methods serve different purposes, yet whether these note making strategies translate well when using our devices such as laptops and smartphones versus pen and paper writing is still largely up for discussion.

## Is the Pen still Mighty?

Coming out of the pandemic, I still believe it is best to write using pen and paper. It feels inexplicably natural. In the past, the consensus also favored note making through pen and paper rather than using our laptops or phones. However, this may already be changing as we continue to adapt new strategies and tools.

A 2008 study "*Learning with Laptops: A Multi-method Case Study*" ^[Learning with Laptops: A Multi-method Case Study(https://education.uci.edu/uploads/7/2/7/6/72769947/laptops-jecr.pdf)] illustrates the importance of laptop use in learning. They investigated how the implementation of laptop programs (i.e., each student is provided with a laptop for learning) for junior high school students affected learning patterns.

The study showed positive results of integrating laptops into their learning program and revealed that students felt it was easier to use their laptops for assignments and creative work. Furthermore, using laptops revealed that students could utilize "just in time learning" or what could also be called as "knowledge on demand". This form of learning allowed students to browse the web for additional information on a topic that would have otherwise been missed by the learning facilitator. This showed that supplemental learning via browsing the internet would be more effective. This practice is now ubiquitous in most of our learning programs. Think of Wikipedia or educational Youtube channels. 

Laptop use in education is becoming more important as we integrate various systems and models. However, the effects of note making through laptops and other digital devices are still widely discussed and inconclusive. There have been numerous studies that investigate performance vis-a-vis note making through longhand writing or laptops. A 2014 study investigated the impact of longhand writing in contrast to using a laptop for notes ^[Mueller, P. A., & Oppenheimer, D. M. (2014). The Pen Is Mightier Than the Keyboard: Advantages of Longhand Over Laptop Note Taking. _Psychological Science_, _25_(6), 1159–1168. (https://www.benjaminjameswaddell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/mueller-the-pen-is-mightier-than-the-keyboard.pdf)]. The study suggests that students who were taking notes via longhand writing rather than those who were using laptops had better performance when it came to conceptual knowledge. This was because handwriting made students more selective when it came to processing information and longhand writing notes acted as better external storage for memory retention than laptops as you are not just mindlessly typing in what is being presented.

As for factual learning, the results with performance were closer as it suggested that factual learning did not really matter whether note taking/making was done via laptop or paper. This could be attributed to how factual knowledge mostly relies on rote memorization. This would suggest that note making towards conceptual knowledge is a major hurdle whereas factual knowledge is easier to adapt.

A review paper by Stacy & Cain (2015) ^[Stacy, E. M., & Cain, J. (2015). Note-taking and Handouts in The Digital Age. _American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education_, _79_(7), 107.(https://www.ajpe.org/content/ajpe/79/7/107.full.pdf)] highlights the different modes of information sharing and teaching in the classroom vis-a-vis note taking. One important aspect of note making that they mentioned was the lack of research we have on how our methods and strategies — such as the Cornell note taking system and outlining methods — translated to the digital tools that we have already started using. They further discussed the importance of how learning applications and software should have the flexibility and ability to accommodate active note making practices and allow for efficient retrieval and review of notes.

*Finally, as digital environments increasingly affect higher education, we should consider the evolving interplay between note-taking, information management, and lifelong learning. The first decades of the digital age has introduced society to a variety of paradigm shifts including how we view the concepts of information storage and retrieval. Educators may need to rethink what it means to take notes and how those notes carry forward into future careers.* – Stacy & Cain

I could go on with more recent studies, however, the discussion remains the same. Current research and data are still inconclusive. Ultimately, knowledge of effective note making and learning strategies in the 21st century is rapidly transforming and evolving. There is a need to adapt to this rapidly changing world. This also calls for teachers to adapt to new technology-enabled learning and to rethink how note making carries forward to future careers. 

Two issues are presented here. First, the reliance on laptops and the internet is now commonplace, however, certain advantages are still awarded through longhand writing notes, especially towards conceptual knowledge. This becomes a problem when we are expected to digest an increasing multitude of information, learning materials, and projects using digital tools.  Yet, when the tools we have for learning and collaboration are not optimized for conceptual knowledge nor is it optimized to fit with our existing note making methods then it can easily become overwhelming leading to a huge cesspool of randomly strewn about information.

Secondly, there is a need to rethink a system that goes outside of the classroom. Note taking is not just a practice for students but an important skill that allows individuals to practice documenting their own work for the future. Note making is not simply an act of copying information but systematically evaluating and synthesizing important information that is useful and valuable. That system must allow for our own personal "knowledge on demand" system and must be designed to be collaborative.

## Toward Better Technology-Enabled Learning

The internet could possibly be best described as a *Library of Babel*. Similar to how Jorge Luis Borges describes the library in his short story, the internet can be conceived as this universe where vast amounts of information and data is stored. However, most of this information is gibberish, uncouth, and unrefined. With some persistence and patience, you may eventually find something valuable and worth your time. But unless we have a system to retrieve that information effectively and efficiently and have it processed to suit our needs, then that information is once again lost to the World Wide Web.

I believe the internet is worth mentioning here as a good amount of learning nowadays also requires a good amount of time researching and browsing on the internet. We also use the internet to engage in collaborative work with our reliance on cloud services and communication software to share information. However, for that information to be usable and valuable, it must be processed and saved to our own personal system. 

Several tools and software have been made to address the issue of note making in a digital environment. Software such Evernote, OneNote, Apple Notes, Notion, and various bookmarking apps have been developed. All these tools have their advantages and disadvantages, but I will be focusing on Obsidian.

I will not be comparing any of these tools as a simple web search will allow you to find thousands of keyboard warriors battling and debating out which software is the best. However, I would like to reiterate that Obsidian is not the one and only solution to note taking/making, it is just one among many possible solutions.

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a writing app that uses simple markdown (.md) files as notes. When using Obsidian for the first time you will be prompted to create a **Vault** (i.e., a folder in your system). This folder will hold all your notes and sub folders. Every note that you create can be accessible via the interface in Obsidian. One thing that already stands out with Obsidian is that you do not have to connect to the internet to be able to use all its features. All your files are saved locally. You own your data and you have access to whatever information you have stored in your vault without needing to go through additional third party software. 

Perhaps two of its most important features are its ability to link notes with bi-directional linking and its added flexibility to design a rich personal knowledge system that utilizes metadata like a Zettelkasten system.

Bi-directional linking of notes allows you to gain deeper insight into how one piece of information relates to and connects another piece of information. In Obsidian this is accomplished by the double bracket `[[Note name here]]`. When learning various concepts and phenomena you want to see how they relate to one another and how they apply to real-world situations. This diverges from the usual learning of isolated facts and information. I could be learning about fundamental concepts about the sources of international law but without my understanding of other concepts of law and specific treaties and historical events, they would not really make that much sense. This was how Wikipedia, and the internet were made.

Metadata provides you with a better ability to retrieve information and notes depending on how your metadata is structured. Adding metadata to your notes allows for quick retrieval and identification of the content that is stored within that note. An example is if we're trying to remember a restaurant that we went to 2 years ago, but we don't remember the exact route, name, and location of the restaurant. However, we do have other identifying information that would allow us to recall where and what it is. Maybe I have pictures saved on that day if I can recall the date, perhaps I remember the name of the owner so I can look him up, or maybe there were some uniquely named establishments nearby that I couldn't forget. All this metadata helps me remember where and what the name of the restaurant is.

Obsidian also has rich community support and an expanding plugin ecosystem to serve as solutions to other unique problems when it comes to note taking/making. It currently has over 1000 plugins, and more are being developed. Other notable features of Obsidian are its customizable workspace layouts, canvas view, and easy to set up and automate templates. 

It's worth noting that Obsidian is still relatively new as it was released in 2020 and it is being developed by a small indie team. Nonetheless, Obsidian as a simple markdown editor outshines its predecessor by giving its users the opportunity to grow and evolve their knowledge management systems without being constrained by insidious practices and unreliable services. You can start using it as a simple markdown editor or have a complex and rich database of specialized knowledge.

## As a Tool for Learning in the Digital Age

Obsidian helps with some of the issues I've outlined above. As a tool, it helps address the issue of conceptual knowledge note making. However, this will only work when we apply already existing learning methods such as active recall and spaced repetition or other note making methods. By using these methods in conjunction with bi-directional linking we enable a streamlined approach to conceptual learning that results in a comprehensive documentation of one's learning processes and understanding of different interrelated concepts. 

Secondly, if you strip down Obsidian to its core, it's just a markdown editor. This ensures that notes are safe from any changes made to the software. Word processors like Microsoft Word can sometimes break notes and formatting depending on the version being used. Obsidian does not have this problem as markdown is too basic of a format to be broken (However, this assumes that you have not modified Obsidian with over a hundred plugins and snippets).

With some additional plugins, Obsidian can enable a personalized workspace and information storage. Furthermore, with metadata and bi-directional linking, you can create a rich "knowledge on demand" database of your personal notes and work process that can be quickly retrieved and shared anytime.

Lastly, there needs to be a shift toward learning in education. Note making is a vital skill that everyone can develop. It enables us the chance to record vital information, document our work, and share it with others. As we document more of our learning and work processes, we promote a culture of collaboration and consistency. Obsidian provides this opportunity being a simple but feature-rich writing software. It is not a perfect tool, but it is a tool that we can reliably carry into the future.
